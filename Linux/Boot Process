1.BIOS
.The first program that runs when you on the computer.

.Perform POST (Power-on self-test) it's mean first it check all connected device (hardwear,extrnal devices) are all in proper condition or not.

.check for bootable device like pen drive,hardDisk etc.(check it's has or not.I will be able to load the operating system)

.BIOS is old one and new one is UEFI (Unified Extrensible Fireware Interface)




2.MBR(Master Boot Recoder)
The MBR is just 512 bytes of data at the very start of your hard disk.
It tells your computer how to start up and where to find your operating system.


a.Boot loader(446 bytes)
load the main bootloader and OS.

b.Partition table(64 bytes)
It can describe up to 4 primary partitions.


c.Error checking (2 bytes)
It helps check if the MBR is correct or damaged.



3.GRUB(GRand Unified Bootloader)

GRUB is  boot program that start after MBR

It Shows a boot menu(select one)

It load the linux kernel into memory.



4.Kernal
The kernal is part of boot proceess.

One loaded,the kernel manages hardware(CPU,memory,etc) and starts the OS.



5.systemd
systemd is a system manager that starts after the kernel.

First service loaded with process ID 1.

It manages services and processes (like starting the login screen or network).

It keeps the system running smoothly by handling tasks like booting, shutting down, and service management.
